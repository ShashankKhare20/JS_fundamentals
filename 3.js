1-Unary Operators:

    Definition: Unary operators are operators that work with only one operand.
    Example:D
    Increment (++): let x = 5; x++; // x is now 6
    Decrement (--): let y = 8; y--; // y is now 7
    Negation (-): let positive = 10; let negative = -positive; // negative is -10


2-Binary Operators:

    Definition: Binary operators are operators that work with two operands.
    Example:
    Addition (+): let sum = 3 + 7; // sum is 10
    Subtraction (-): let difference = 10 - 4; // difference is 6
    Multiplication (*): let product = 5 * 4; // product is 20
    Division (/): let quotient = 15 / 3; // quotient is 5


3-Ternary Operator:

    Definition: The ternary operator is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands. It's a shorthand for the if-else statement.

    let result = (x > 0) ? "positive" : "non-positive";
