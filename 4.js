Precedence:

    Definition: Precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

    let result = 2 + 3 * 4;
    // In this case, multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+),
    // so the multiplication is performed first, and then the addition.
    // The result is 14, not 20.


Associativity:

    Definition: Associativity defines the order in which operators with the same precedence are grouped when they appear in an expression. It can be left-to-right or right-to-left.

    let result = 6 / 3 / 2;
    // Division is left-to-right associative, so this is equivalent to (6 / 3) / 2,
    // and the result is 1.



Understanding operator precedence and associativity is fundamental for writing accurate, readable, and bug-free JavaScript code. It provides a set of rules that govern how expressions are evaluated, ensuring that the results align with the programmer's intentions.
